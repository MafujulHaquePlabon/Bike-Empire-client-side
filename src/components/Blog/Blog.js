                JavaScript is a language that runs inside web browsers as part of the documents loaded by the browser and is used as a client-side development language. It provides the behavior of the pages. Like HTML it provides the semantic structure and CSS the look and feel.
                However, being an interpreted language, it needs an interpreter to run. V8 is Google Chrome's JS engine and 'node' is a front-end that can be used to run JavaScript scripts outside the browser.

                NodeJs is an open source, cross-platform environment that allows to create server-side applications and tools using JavaScript.

              Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

               MongoDB is a great database for web applications, especially if the application services many users who do not interact with each other.MongoDB is a powerful database with many capabilities. MongoDB is ideal for cloud computing. Cloud-based storage needs to easily distribute data across multiple servers, which suits MongoDB's nature perfectly. Need my data fast and easily accessible.
